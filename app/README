Answer to Part #5: BART APIs allow CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), so it is possible for my website to load and display data. 
    In the response payload header we see the Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*, which permits access to the requests originating from my website 
    (or any cross origin) to the BART API from my website
